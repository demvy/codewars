"""
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed. Each segment is 8 bits meaning the order of these segments need to be reversed:

11111111 00000000 00001111 10101010

(byte1) (byte2) (byte3) (byte4)

10101010 00001111 00000000 11111111

(byte4) (byte3) (byte2) (byte1)

Total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8. The data is given in an array as such:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
